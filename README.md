# Automated_maskDet_DS

Automated_maskDet_DS is a sophisticated machine learning project designed to enhance public safety by monitoring mask compliance in real-time video feeds. This system detects individuals who are not wearing masks and tracks their movements within the video frame.

## Key Features

- **Mask Detection:** Utilizes advanced computer vision techniques to accurately identify people wearing or not wearing masks in real-time.
- **Path Tracking:** Tracks the movement of individuals who are not wearing masks, providing a visual path of their trajectory.
- **Real-Time Analysis:** Processes video feeds in real-time, ensuring immediate detection and response.
- **Scalable Solution:** Suitable for integration with various surveillance systems in public places such as malls, airports, and offices.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SRMannan/Automated_maskDet_DS.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Automated_maskDet_DS
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. To start the mask detection, run the following command:
    ```bash
    python detect_mask_video.py
    ```

2. The script will start processing the video feed and will display the video with mask detection and path tracking..
